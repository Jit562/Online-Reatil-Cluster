Online Retail Cluster 

This project focuses on analyzing online retail data to uncover insights through clustering techniques. The primary goal is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, enabling personalized marketing strategies and improved customer experience.

Data Collection and Preparation: The dataset used comprises transaction records from an online retail store. Key features include customer ID, transaction date, item description, quantity, and purchase amount. Data preprocessing involves cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and aggregating transactions to derive meaningful features such as total spend and freque.
